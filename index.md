Hi, there. I am currently pursuing Ph.D at College of Control Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University under supervision of Professor Junfeng Wu. \\
I worked on some robotics projects and really enjoy the process of making a automatic car from scratch.

## Research Interest
I am fasinating about multi-agent reinforcement learning. Currently I am exploring the proof of various reinforcement learning algorithms. 

## Publication
Stay curious
