# About me
Hi, there. I am currently pursuing Ph.D at College of Control Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University under supervision of Professor Junfeng Wu. 
I worked on some robotics projects and really enjoy the process of making a automatic car from scratch. I love volleyball and still is improving my skills. I am also learning Blender for 3d-modeling (not so frequently though, lol). 

## Research Interest
I am fasinating about multi-agent reinforcement learning. Currently I am exploring the proof of various reinforcement learning algorithms. 

## Publication
Stay curious please.
